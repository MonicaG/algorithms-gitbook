# LeetCode

## Resources

* [Tech Interview Handbook - Best Practice Questions](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/)

## My Notes

* Use the test runner to verify my understanding of the leetcode question. Have the solution return a dummy value. Put in my test cases and get the results to verify my understanding.
* Record test cases in a comment at the end of a problem in leetcode. This way if I go back to look at the problem, I have a handy set of test cases to use.
