# 207. Course Schedule

## Description

See: [https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

## Solution

This is a graph question. To be a valid course schedule the graph will need to be a [directed acycle graph (DAG)](../../data-structures/graph.md#directed-acyclic-graph-dag).  If a cycle is found then the course schedule is NOT valid.

There are two solutions to this problem:

* [DFS](207.-course-schedule.md#dfs-solution)&#x20;
* [Kahn's algorithm](207.-course-schedule.md#undefined)

### DFS Solution

[DFS](../../algorithms/depth-first-search-dfs.md#traversal) tranversal can be used to walk the graph and detect any cycles. The DFS algorithm is modified to keep track of the status of a vertex. The statuses are:

* Not visited
* Processing&#x20;
* Processed

### Invalid Course Schedule

When traversing the graph, if a vertex is found to be in "Processing" status then a cycle has been detected.&#x20;

For example, assume the following class schedule \[\[0, 1], \[1, 0]]. Here the class schedule says:

* class 0 has a prerequisite of class 1
* class 1 has a prerequisite of class 0

So, there is a cycle. When traversing the graph, we will visit vertex 0, traverse to vertex 1 and then back to vertex 0. Because vertex 0 is in status "processing" a cycle is detected.

Now we are in a cycle because course 1 has a prerequisite of course 0 (which is in status "processing"). So the algorithm can stop because we now know the course schedule is invalid.

### Valid Course Schedule

If the algorithm does not encounter any vertices with "processing" status, then there are not cycles and the course schedule is valid.

Example: assume the following course schedule: \[\[0,1], \[1,2]]. This means:

* Course 0 has a prerequisite of Course 1
* Course 1 has a prerequisite of Course 2

Here there are no cycles. So, when following the edges from a vertex we will not encounter a vertex in "processing status". If we come across a vertex that has status "processed" then we can skip it. We have already traversed it and found it to be valid. So there is no point in processing it again.

### Algorithm&#x20;

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List
from enum import Enum


class Status(Enum):
    NOT_VISITED = 0
    PROCESSING = 1
    PROCESSED = 2


class Solution:

    def dfs(self, start, course_graph, visited) -> bool:
        # We will keep track of the status of each vertex. If we come across a processed vertex then we can exit as we don't need to reprocess it
        if visited[start] == Status.PROCESSED:
            return True
        # If we come across a vertex that is marked as "processing" then we have encountered a cycle. We are currently processing that vertex and one of its edges led back to it! So, we can return False as it is not a valid course schedule
        if visited[start] == Status.PROCESSING:
            return False
        visited[start] = Status.PROCESSING
        # defaultdict will automatically add a key if it is not found in the dict. The if statement is here to prevent a key from being added if it does not exist
        if start in course_graph:
            for node in course_graph[start]:
                if not self.dfs(node, course_graph, visited):
                    # we enountered a vertex that was in processing status. So a cycle exits. Return False as the course prerequisites are not valid.
                    return False
        # If we make it here then a cycle did not exist and the course prerequistes are valid.
        # Mark the vertex as processed so we do not prcess it again. We've determined this course has valid prerequisites.
        visited[start] = Status.PROCESSED
        return True

    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # create a graph where the keys are the courses and the values are the prerequisites for each course
        course_graph = defaultdict(list)
        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            course_graph[course].append(prereq)

        visited = [Status.NOT_VISITED] * numCourses

        # every key needs to be traversed because the graph may be disconnected
        for key in course_graph:
            if not self.dfs(key, course_graph, visited):
                return False

        return True

```
{% endcode %}

### Kahn's Algorithm Solution

[Kahn's Algorithm](../../algorithms/kahns-algorithm.md) can also be used to detect a valid course schedule.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
from typing import List
class Solution:
    
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # create a graph where the keys are the courses and the values are the prerequisites for each course
        course_graph = defaultdict(list)
        # this array keeps track of how many edges are incoming to a vertex (how many dependecies a course has)
        # because the course ids are 0 <= a, b <= numCourses, array index is course id 
        incoming_edges = [0] * numCourses

        # populate the incoming_edges with the number of prerequisites for each course
        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            course_graph[prereq].append(course)
            incoming_edges[course] += 1


        # initialize the queue with any courses that do NOT have any prerequisites
        processing_queue = deque()
        for course, prereq in enumerate(incoming_edges):
            if prereq == 0:
                processing_queue.append(course)

        # we don't need a topological ordering for this scenario. We just need to know if the schedule is valid or not
        # so just keep track of the number of classes processed. If it differs from the graph size then the schedule is
        # invalid
        num_classes_processed = 0
        while processing_queue:
            num_classes_processed += 1
            course = processing_queue.pop()
            for dependency in course_graph[course]:
                incoming_edges[dependency] -= 1
                if incoming_edges[dependency] == 0:
                    processing_queue.append(dependency)
        return num_classes_processed == numCourses
```
{% endcode %}
