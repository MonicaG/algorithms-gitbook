## Description

See description at [https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

## Solutions

### Kadane's Algorithm

See [Kadane's Algorithm](53.-maximum-subarray.md#kadanes-algorithm)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        current_sum = nums[0]
        high_sum = current_sum
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            current_sum = max(nums[i], current_sum + nums[i])
            high_sum = max(current_sum, high_sum)
            
        return high_sum
```



### My Solution

I was on the right track to the optimal solution which is Kadane's Algorithm. I should have taken extra time to look at my nested if statements. I knew it was bad, but just submitted anyway. If I stopped and looked closer, I think I could have simplified it closer to Kadane's Algorithm. I was happy I found the O(N) solution.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        current_sum = nums[0]
        high_sum = current_sum
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if current_sum < 0:
                if nums[i] > 0:
                    current_sum = nums[i]
                else:
                    current_sum = max(current_sum, nums[i])
            else:
                current_sum += nums[i]
            high_sum = max(current_sum, high_sum)
            
        return high_sum
```
